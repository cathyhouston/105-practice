                <p>Hello fellow Skillcrushers! I must say, I really felt stumped at this stage. Me? Give advice? I guess I can only pull from my own experience.</p>

                <p>There will be times of challenge, excitement, confusion, elation, triumph, you name it! We all love the triumphs, but it can be very discouraging during those times of confusion. I'll tell you what I tell myself, “press on!” :) because just past that hurdle is, you guessed it, “success”!</p>

                <h2>Your future awaits!</h2>
                <p>The road ahead looks immense and faraway but upon reflection I can see just how far I've already come, how far we've all come. Just imagine where we'll all be at this exact same time next year if we just keep at it!</p>
